title: Signal Processing and Media Application group
---

The Signal Processing Media Applications Group (Sigmedia) is a
research group in the [Department of Electrical and Electronic
Engineering](https://tcd.ie/eleceng) at [Trinity College
Dublin](https://tcd.ie/).

## Research

Our research activities are centred on digital signal processing
technology. We exploit knowledge from statistics, applied mathematics,
computer vision, image and video processing, and speech and language
understanding in order to solve very unique problems in a range of
domains. There are three main research themes for the group:

  - Digital Cinema and Restoration
  - Video Compression
  - Human Speech Communication

We are well known for our work on cinema post-production and our
motion estimation technology (in collaboration with
[Foundry](https://foundry.com)) is used around the world for film
special effects in movies like Matrix, Lord of the Rings, X-Men,
Spider Man, Harry Potter and so on. This work was recognised by the
[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 2007]().


## Collaboration

Sigmedia researchers have been involved with many EU projects
(i3dpost, MOUMIR, PRESTOSPACE) and have associations with archive
companies around Europe. We are currently involved in EU COST Actions
IC1106 and IC1105. A number of our current projects are funded by
Science Foundation Ireland, IRCSET and Enterprise Ireland. We
collaborate closely with Industry, including, Google, DTS, Lightstream
Animation and Foundry. The group has a close association with
Prof. Frank Boland's Audio, Acoustics and Music Research Group, with
many joint projects.
